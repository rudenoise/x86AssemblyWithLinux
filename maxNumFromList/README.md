# Maximum Number

This is based on the _maximum number_ program from _Programming
from the Ground Up_.

To use:
```sh
# build
make
# run
./max.out
# > 54321
```

The program contains an array of numbers in memory. It cycycles
through these numbers and finds the largest.

Once it has reached the end of the list, it converts the largest
number to its ASCII representation in decimal.

It then writes the result to _std_out_.
